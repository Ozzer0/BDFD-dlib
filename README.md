# BDFD-dlib

The first BDFD library, granted it's horrible. But works.

To use this library, simply paste the below, with the functions and their required values.
```
$httpGet[https://rentry.org/dlibsource/raw]
$eval[$httpResult]
```

Example usage
```
$nomention
$var[:rng;60-W-L]
$httpGet[https://rentry.org/dlibsource/raw]
$eval[$httpResult]
```
This code will either return "W" with a 60% chance, or "L" with a 40% chance.
